- Docker: Compatibility with c-lightning v0.8.0 network subdirectories

- Detect if the "base directory" is provided and default to the bitcoin mainnet network subdirectory within in. (#130)

  This allows users to start spark using the existing command they use (with i.e. `--ln-path ~/.lightning`)
  to ease the upgrade to c-lightning v0.8.0, but this usage is considered deprecated and will eventually be removed.
  Users are advised to explicitly specify the path to the network subdirectory with `--ln-path ~/.lightning/<network>`.

- Don't display unconfirmed onchain balance (#129)

  This was possible before v0.2.11 which updated the Android SDK to version 28.

## 0.2.6 - 2019-06-07

- Changed the way the balance shown in the top-right corner is calculated. See:

  https://github.com/shesek/spark-wallet/issues/62

  https://github.com/shesek/spark-wallet/commit/9b500c48c4c32fd61a11995410f17adf9f6cdf8d

- Display channel and on-chain balances separately on the homepage (#67)

- Add support for running a Tor hidden service in non-anonymous mode. This makes the hidden service faster, at the cost of losing the privacy benefits.

  From the [Tor documentation](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html#HiddenServiceSingleHopMode):

  > Non Anonymous Hidden Services on a tor instance in HiddenServiceSingleHopMode make one-hop (direct) circuits between the onion service server, and the introduction and rendezvous points. (Onion service descriptors are still posted using 3-hop paths, to avoid onion service directories blocking the service.) This option makes every hidden service instance hosted by a tor instance a Single Onion Service. One-hop circuits make Single Onion servers easily locatable, but clients remain location-anonymous. However, the fact that a client is accessing a Single Onion rather than a Hidden Service may be statistically distinguishable.

  To enable this mode, set `--onion-nonanonymous`.

- Allow specifying a proxy server for making HTTP requests (currently, requests are only sent for fetching the exchange rate)
  using the standard `HTTP(S)_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` environment variables or the `--proxy` CLI arg (which is an alias for `ALL_PROXY`).
  See [proxy-from-env](https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env) for more details.

- Add support for fetching exchanges rates from the Wasabi API (#78)

  Can be set with `--rate-provider wasabi` (requires Tor, either as a transparent proxy or using `--proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050`).

- Allow disabling exchange rate lookup using `--no-rates` (#81)

- Switch from Oracle Java to OpenJDK for building the Android app (#79, #84)

- Update to Electron v5
